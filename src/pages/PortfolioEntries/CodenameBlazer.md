Codename Blazer is a now-defunct project that was intended to be an investigatory roguelike in similar style to Risk of Rain, with an evidence manipulation system. When I bit off more than I could chew animation-wise the project was canceled, but from that, I managed to build some interesting systems for the game.

The one I was most proud of was that Evidence Manipulation system. I wanted to encourage players to create a massive board of evidence that was wild and unrestrained, with piles of evidence all over the place. I wanted individual pieces of evidence to able to be organized, while also giving players tools to examine them in different unique ways.

Given that I was still very new to game development at the time, I spent an undue amount of time trying to solve what was a very simple problem instead of trying to improve the usability of the UI/UX. Most of my time went into developing the corkboard pins holding objects in place and the ultraviolet light lamp for pieces of evidence.

Many of the issues that I ran into during this project could be completed in less than an afternoon now, but I do look back fondly on how much potential those systems had.
